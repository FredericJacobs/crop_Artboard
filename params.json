{"name":"Resizer","tagline":"Sketch App to Skala Preview Resizer","body":"# Resizer for Sketch App + Skala\r\n\r\nI've been using Sketch App for a few months now, I really love it. But since I'm working mostly on mobile the lack of compatibility with Skala Preview annoyed me.\r\n\r\nIf you don't know about Sketch App, [read about it here in french](http://checkthis.com/sketch) or [check the official website](http://www.bohemiancoding.com/sketch/).\r\n\r\nToday, [Thibaut Ninove](https://twitter.com/tbnv) pointed out that he had a script that was exporting the Sketch App art boards to the clipboard. Unfortunately, there is a bug in Sketch App that exports them with a border of a random number of pixels (well, it's probably not random but I couldn't figure out the logic). \r\n\r\nSince I love that app so much (and I'm not the only one out there), I created a complement app that fetches the newly exported artboards from SketchApp and that removes the frame so that it can be tried in Skala Preview.\r\n\r\nSince I couldn't find how to measure the margin accurately, the app requires the user to set the margin size himself when he changes to an artboard that has a different size.\r\n\r\n## How to set up ?\r\n\r\nThe set up works occurs in two part.\r\n\r\nYou'll need to download : [Resize.zip](http://cl.ly/MyKh)\r\n\r\n### Set up a shortcut to export from SketchApp to the clipboard\r\n\r\nGo to the Sketch App Preferences and enable scripting.\r\n\r\nNow on the \"Plugins\" Menu Bar tab, click on Custom Script >> Settings gear >> Open Plugins Folder.\r\n\r\nDrag and drop the script (export.jstalk) that is in the archive you downloaded in that folder.\r\n\r\nNow when you hit \"control+command+C\", it will copy your art board to the clipboard.\r\n\r\n### Set up the resizer that fetches the clipboard content from SketchApp and that serves it to Skala.\r\n\r\nJust open the Resize.app and you should be ready to go.\r\n\r\n## Customization\r\n\r\nEverything is open-source (except Skala and Sketch App), feel free to customize it.\r\n\r\nTo change your keyboard shortcut, take a look at the [Bohemian Coding Scripting Documentation](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/scripting/)\r\n\r\n## Special thanks\r\n\r\nThanks to [Thibaut Ninove](https://twitter.com/tbnv) for the challenge and Yara for the mental support.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
